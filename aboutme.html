    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="pg-settings">I feel like I'm not quite grown up yet, even though I've been around for about three decades.  My wife would probably agree with that, too.  I searched for a long time for something to really put my mind too and couldn't find anything that caught my attention the right way.  Recently I've been working for a radio station, which is a lot of fun but hardly rewarding.  Now I've started coding and it seems like a good fit.  Even the simplest things feel like problems that need to be solved, and if there's anything I love it's solving problems.</p>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
      <p class="pg-settings">I grew up as a Navy brat and moved all over the East Coast, as far north as Newport, RI and as far south as Key West, FL.  My family is from Winston-Salem, NC, and we moved back here when I was 14.  I've been here ever since, with the exception of a few minor interruptions.  It's not a bad place to live, not at all.</p>

    <h2 class="top-margin font1">About Me</h2>
    <h3 class="font2">What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
          <p class="font1 pg-settings">Reading, board ops at the radio station (Just because I get paid to do it doesn't mean I can't love doing it.), playing tug-of-war with my puppy Emma, and being best friends with my wife.</p>
    <h3 class="font2">What is your dream job?</h3>
         <p class="font1 pg-settings">I would love a job where I contribute to problem solving and critical thinking, where each person's voice is valued and considered and solutions come by combining our strengths to do amazing things.</p>
    <h3 class="font2">What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
      <p class="font1 pg-settings">Power of Love by Huey Lewis and the News<br>
